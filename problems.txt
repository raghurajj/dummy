1)The delete functionality is not working properly. I mean it's picking the first task in the list and
 delete it when we click "Remove", and not giving us option to delete the task which we actually want
 to delete.

2)It's not checking if the task we are adding is empty or not. and adding it anyway.

3)It would be better if we maintain a seperate file for the javascript part in todo.ejs.

4)we are sending post request to delete a task that's not quite a good idea. we should use "delete"
  request to delete a task.
